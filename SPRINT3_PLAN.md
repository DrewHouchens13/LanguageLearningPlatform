   - Incident response procedures
   - Sprint 3 implementation details

3. **Updated CLAUDE.md** - Added:

## CI Pipeline Changes

### Option A: Direct to Main (RECOMMENDED)

**Rationale**: CI pipeline changes affect everyone, pushing directly to main ensures:
- Everyone gets changes immediately
- No confusion about which branch to use
- Faster adoption
- Simpler workflow

**Process**:
```bash
# Pull latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Add new workflow files
git add .github/workflows/lint.yml
git add .github/workflows/security.yml
git add .pylintrc
git add .bandit
git add .semgrep.yml

# Commit
git commit -m "Sprint 3: Add CI linting and security scanning"

# Push directly to main
git push origin main
```

**Team Communication**:
- Announce in standup/team meeting
- Email team with changes
- Share new documentation
- Provide local setup instructions

### Option B: Feature Branch + PR

If team prefers review process:
```bash
git checkout -b sprint3/ci-improvements
# ... make changes ...
git push origin sprint3/ci-improvements
# Create PR, get quick team review, merge
```

## CI Workflow Files

### 1. Lint Workflow (.github/workflows/lint.yml)

```yaml
name: Lint

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  pylint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install pylint pylint-django

      - name: Run Pylint
        run: |
          pylint home/ config/ --rcfile=.pylintrc --fail-under=9.0
```

**Key Points**:
- Runs on pushes to main/develop and all PRs
- Requires score â‰¥9.0 (currently at 9.91)
- Uses project's `.pylintrc` configuration
- Fails build if score drops below threshold

### 2. Security Workflow (.github/workflows/security.yml)

```yaml
name: Security Scans

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    # Run weekly on Mondays at 9am
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'

jobs:
  bandit:
    name: Bandit Security Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install Bandit
        run: pip install bandit

      - name: Run Bandit
        run: bandit -r home/ config/ -c .bandit

  safety:
    name: Dependency Security Check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install safety

      - name: Run Safety
        run: safety check

  pip-audit:
    name: Pip Audit
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install pip-audit
        run: pip install pip-audit

      - name: Run pip-audit
        run: pip-audit -r requirements.txt
```

**Key Points**:
- Runs on pushes, PRs, and weekly schedule
- Three security tools: Bandit, Safety, pip-audit
- Weekly scheduled scans catch new vulnerabilities
- Generates reports for review

2. **Security Scans** - Bandit, Safety, and pip-audit running automatically
3. **Style Guide** - See STYLE_GUIDE.md for coding standards
4. **Security Guide** - See SECURITY_GUIDE.md for security practices

**What This Means For You**:
- PRs must pass all checks before merging
- Run tools locally before pushing (see instructions below)
- CI will catch issues automatically
- We'll maintain high code quality standards

**Local Setup**:
```bash
pip install pylint pylint-django bandit safety pip-audit
```

**Run Before Committing**:
```bash
pylint home/ config/
pytest
```

**Questions**: Ask in #dev-team or during standup

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Pylint is too strict"
**Solution**:
- `.pylintrc` already configured with reasonable settings
- Can disable specific checks with comments: `# pylint: disable=rule-name`
- Discuss as team if threshold should be adjusted

### Issue: "Security scans find vulnerabilities"
**Solution**:
- High/Critical: Fix immediately before merge
- Medium: Create issue, fix in same sprint
- Low: Add to backlog
- See SECURITY_GUIDE.md for severity levels

### Issue: "CI is slow"
**Solution**:
- Optimize workflow (cache dependencies)
- Run security scans in parallel
- Consider reducing frequency of some checks

### Issue: "Too many false positives"
**Solution**:
- Add to exclusion config
- Document why it's safe
- Report to tool maintainers
